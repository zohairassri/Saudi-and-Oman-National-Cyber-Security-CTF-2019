1-First of all i search in : Source code , cookie , ....... but i can't found any result !!!

2-in second step i use SQLMAP tool but after a long time ....  no result.

When i intercept the request i found interesting thing  : 
"X-Forwarded-For" or XFF HTTP header field 
is a common method for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through
an HTTP proxy or load balancer.

And with the "Privacy Note" i make sure that XFF is vulnerable and i use it o inject some payload : 

curl --header "X-Forwarder-For : my@ip 'union select 1,2,3,(select sql from sqlite_master)-- -" -v http://35.222.174.178/maria/

in PHPSESSID i get the result hhhh : 
  i noticed that there is a new table "nxf8_users" that contain ip,name,role,password for users
but this is just a trap ;) 

But I know that there is a column name ip_address in "nxf8_sessios" that's good 
i found 3 @ip  :

finally i use this to get COOKIE for maria : 
  curl --header "X-Forwarder-For : @ip1" -v http://35.222.174.178/maria/   === cookie is not working
  curl --header "X-Forwarder-For : @ip2" -v http://35.222.174.178/maria/   === Good cookie for me 
  
 i put the following cookie in  browser to get the flag

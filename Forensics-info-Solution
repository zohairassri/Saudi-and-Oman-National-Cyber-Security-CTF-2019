When executing the firt command "file" for image  i found !!!

1- file info.png
info.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, aspect ratio, density 1x1, segment length 16, comment: "badisbad", baseline, precision 8, 194x259, frames 3

I think that the comment "badisbad" is very interesting it's password for something ??

let's try the classical tool "Steghide"  : 

  steghide extract -sf info.jpg
  Enter passphrase: badisbad
  
  wrote extracted data to "flaggg.txt"
So let's cat this file ; 

cat flaggg.txt 
flag{Stegn0_1s_n!ce}
